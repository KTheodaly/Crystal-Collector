# Gem Game

## What is this repo project?

* This repo is a fun javascript powered game called Gems

## How does it work?

* There will be four gems displayed as buttons on the page.

   * The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

   * When the player clicks on a gem, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 

     * Your game will hide this amount until the player clicks a gem.
     * When they do click one, update the player's score counter.

   * The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

   * The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

     * When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the gems will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.

   * The app should show the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.

## Who will use this repo?

* This is for practice utilizing jQuery, but the game is open to anyone who wants to explore the code or play for fun.

## What is the goal of the project?

* Create an interactive game for the web using jQuery!
